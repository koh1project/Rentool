        <p class="service__description">"Rentool is a contactless tool rental service." </p>
        <p class="service__description">Our service is for individuals or small groups who may need a certain tool to complete a task but do not have access to that tool. </p>
        <p class="service__description">We allow these persons to acquire these tools for a set time period based on their needs. They will be able to acquire and return the tools at any of our tool locker locations, based on the availability of the tool.</p>
        <p class="service__description">We encourage users to check the availability and make a reservation before they go to the tool lockerâ€™s location. After the reservation, users need to pick up the tool and complete the payment within a certain period of time. Users will complete the payment at the terminal machine embedded with the lockers. The whole process does not involve any contact.</p>
        <p class="service__description">Return tool is as simple as the reservation. Before the expiry, users choose any locker location they prefer to return the tool. Go there, put the tool in one locker. Close the door. Return complete.</p>
        <p class="service__description">We provide 24*7 services. Users could have the most flexibility to access our services. We also have a professional team that will check the returned tools in detail to ensure that each user has a well-functioned tool to rent.</p>
